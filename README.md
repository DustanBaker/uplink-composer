# The Composer

One tool to build bootable installation USB media for a fleet: pull and store
OS images, keep per-hardware driver packs, compose unattended install media
per machine/org (drivers + unattend + first-boot agents), and write verified
USB sticks. Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux from a single static binary.

Org-agnostic by design: everything specific to an organization — recipes,
unattend templates, pinned download manifests, driver packs — lives in that
org's own **workspace** (a small git repo). `composer init` scaffolds one in
seconds.

## What it produces

- **Windows 10/11 unattended installers** — FAT32, UEFI-boot, `autounattend.xml`
  + `ei.cfg` + `$OEM$` payload; drivers install at first boot via `pnputil`
  (never DISM-injected), agents install at first boot (never baked — cloned
  agent identities collide in RMMs). WIMs over FAT32's 4 GiB limit are split
  automatically (DISM on Windows hosts, wimlib elsewhere).
- **Linux distro installers** — hybrid ISOs raw-written and verified.
- **Appliance images** — raw `.img` (xz/zstd/gz-compressed supported),
  stream-decompressed while writing.

UEFI-only by explicit constraint. Legacy BIOS boot is out of scope.

## How it works

**Compose to image, then flash.** The composer builds a raw disk image file
(partition table + FAT32 + files) entirely in userspace — no admin rights, no
mounting — then the flash engine raw-writes it to the stick and verifies by
readback hash. One identical build path on all three OSes; images are
reproducible byte-for-byte (`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`), cacheable, and safe to
archive as masters.

Multi-gigabyte binaries never live in git. Workspace **manifests** pin
`url` + `sha256` (`composer sources pull`); files with rotating links, like
consumer Windows ISOs, are added by hand once per machine
(`composer sources import`). Everything lands in a machine-local
content-addressed **library**.

Safety, inherited from the shell script this tool generalizes: only
removable USB devices are ever flashable, the disk hosting the OS is
hard-refused, flashing requires typing the target's exact size, stale GPT
backup headers are wiped, and every write is verified by readback (which
also catches counterfeit flash).

## Quick start

```
composer init --org "Acme IT" acme-workspace
cd acme-workspace
composer sources import example-win11-iso D:\Downloads\Win11_24H2.iso
composer build example-win11
composer devices
composer flash example-win11 <device-id>
```

`composer serve` opens the same workflow as a local web page (loopback-only,
token-protected): recipes, devices, one-click builds, an arm-then-flash
dialog with the typed-size interlock enforced server-side, and live progress
over SSE. `composer capture <device>` reads a working stick (through its
last partition) into the library as a master image — the generalized
"capture the golden stick" workflow.

`composer doctor` checks the host: on Windows and macOS the ISO/WIM tooling
is built into the OS (Mount-DiskImage/hdiutil, DISM); Linux needs `7zz` and
`wimlib`.

## Status

Early but real: the FAT32 composer passes a native acid test (Windows mounts
a composed image, `chkdsk` reports zero problems, 400+ files hash-identical
through the Windows FAT driver, byte-reproducible builds), the full Windows
pipeline — captured-master trees, ISO extraction, overlays, driver packs,
generated first-boot scripts — is integration-tested, and the first physical
stick flashed on Windows verified 413/413 files through the OS FAT driver.
The web UI is live. macOS/Linux flash paths are written but not yet
hardware-tested; the Windows-ISO end-to-end and a physical unattended
install are the next acceptance milestones.

## Development

```
go build ./cmd/composer
go test ./... -short
```

Pure Go plus `github.com/diskfs/go-diskfs` for partition tables and FAT32
(with two workarounds found by the acid test: io/fs-style paths for reads,
and a post-pass fixing `..` cluster entries of top-level directories to 0
per the FAT spec). External tools (7-Zip, wimlib, DISM) are always invoked
as subprocesses, never linked.
